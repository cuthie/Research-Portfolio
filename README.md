# Research Portfolio
Welcome! I'm a postdoctoral researcher specializing in data-driven modelling, control, and signal processing. This repository showcases practical projects and research prototypes that are relevant to industry-focused roles in autonomous systems, digital twins, and predictive modeling.

## Contents
- 🔧 [Hybrid MPC for Nonlinear Systems](projects/project3_hybrid_mpc/)
- 🌐 [Cloud-native Distributed Controller](projects/project2_cloud_control/)
- 🎯 [Sensor Fusion + Kalman Estimation](projects/project1_digital_twin/)
- 📈 Signal processing with Stochastic Control

Each project includes code, results, and documentation to support reproducibility and industrial relevance.
