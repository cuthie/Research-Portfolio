# Industrial Research Portfolio
Welcome! I'm a postdoctoral researcher specializing in data-driven modelling, control, and signal processing. This repository highlights practical projects and research prototypes relevant to industry-focused research roles in autonomous systems, digital twins, and predictive modelling.

## Contents
- 🔧 [Hybrid MPC for Nonlinear Systems](projects/project3_hybrid_mpc/)
- 🌐 [Cloud-native Distributed Controller](projects/project2_cloud_control/)
- 🎯 [Sensor Fusion + Kalman Estimation](projects/project1_digital_twin/)
- 📈 Signal processing demos and notebooks

Each project includes code, results, and documentation to support reproducibility and industrial relevance.
