# 🧪 Research Portfolio – [Emma Green]

Welcome to my research portfolio!  
I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** specializing in **data-driven modelling, control systems, and AI applications**.  
My work bridges **academic research** and **industrial applications**, with experience in:
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Data-driven and cloud-native control architectures
- AI explainability (LIME, SHAP)
- Signal processing in wireless sensor networks
- Applied machine learning for engineering systems

## Contents
- 🔧 [Data-driven Modelling + Control]
- 🌐 [Cloud-native Secure Controller]
- 📈 [Signal processing with Stochastic Control]

Each project includes code, results, and documentation to support reproducibility and industrial relevance.
